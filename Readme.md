#### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces. One of the big benefits is to enable IDEs to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors as you type the code.In Simple Words its a Super Set of JavaScript.
It adds static typing to the language. Static typing is a way to describe the shape of an object by defining the types of its properties. This allows the compiler to validate that your code is working correctly. It can catch errors early before your code runs, and it can simplify refactoring, by giving you better tooling.
